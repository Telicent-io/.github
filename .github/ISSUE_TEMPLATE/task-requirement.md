## Background/Context

<!--Include some background context if necessary, link any related tickets here if it helps build the story.-->

## Task

<!--What is the task/requirement? What do we need to do? Try not to solutionise here, just state the requirement. If there's a design to follow, make that clear here.-->

Requirements can be written in 'As a... I want... so that' form, or as short sentences.

## Acceptance Criteria

<!--Written in Given, When, Then statement(s) where possible so it's easily testable - some tickets won't require this, in which case bullet points are fine. Remember to include unhappy scenarios too! -->

**Given** [set some preconditions]
**When** [I perform an action]
**Then** [some follow up thing happens that meets the requirement :D]

**Screenshots**

<!-- Add screenshots if appropriate, especially if implementing a design-->
